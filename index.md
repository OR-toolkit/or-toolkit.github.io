# OR-toolkit

## About / Mission

OR-toolkit is a research-oriented organization dedicated to developing and maintaining high-quality tools and libraries for Operations Research and optimization problems. Our mission is to provide accessible, efficient, and well-documented implementations of advanced optimization techniques that can be used by researchers, students, and practitioners alike.

We focus on creating modular, extensible solutions that address real-world optimization challenges while maintaining academic rigor and practical applicability.

## Projects

Our main repositories showcase different aspects of optimization and Operations Research:

### Column Generation
Advanced algorithms and tools for solving large-scale optimization problems using column generation techniques. This project provides efficient implementations of Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and cutting-stock problem solvers.

**Repository:** [Column Generation](https://github.com/OR-toolkit/Column-Generation)

### Stochastic Programming
Tools and frameworks for modeling and solving optimization problems under uncertainty. Includes scenario generation, stochastic decomposition methods, and sample average approximation techniques.

**Repository:** [Stochastic Programming](https://github.com/OR-toolkit/Stochastic-Programming)
