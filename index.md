# Operations Research Suite 

## About / Mission

Operations Research Suite (OR-toolkit) is a research-oriented organization dedicated to developing and maintaining high-quality tools and libraries for Operations Research and optimization problems. Our mission is to provide accessible, efficient, and well-documented implementations of advanced optimization techniques that can be used by researchers, students, and practitioners alike.

We focus on creating modular, extensible solutions that address real-world optimization challenges while maintaining academic rigor and practical applicability.

## Projects

Our main repositories showcase different aspects of optimization and Operations Research:

### Vehicle Routing Problem with Column Generation
This project addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) and its variants by employing a Dantzig–Wolfe reformulation combined with a column generation approach.

**Repository:** [Vehicle Routing with Column Generation](https://github.com/OR-toolkit/vrptw)

### Stochastic Programming with Recourse formulation
Implements a stochastic optimization problem using the Stochastic Programs with Recourse formulation. The goal is to analyze and solve the problem under different demand variances using various models.

**Repository:** [Stochastic Programming with Recourse formulation](https://github.com/OR-toolkit/site-allocation-solver)
